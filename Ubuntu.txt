# List of demonstrated commands
# Generally, commands are entered: 
command -parameters argument

# You can use the tabulator key to auto-complete commands, file names and paths
# You can use the arrow keys left/right to correct command lines
# You can use the up arrow key to navigate your command history


# Directories ------------------------------------------------------------------

# to display the full path of the present work directory
pwd

# list directory
ls
# options are entered with a preceding dash - 
ls -lah # l = list, a = show hidden files, h = human readable file sizes
# cd change directory
# / = root of your file system
cd /
cd var # cd <foldername>, here into the folder named var
# to go one level up, use ..
cd ..
# to go back to your user home folder, use cd ~ or just
cd

# create a new folder/directory
mkdir mydir
# remove a folder with
rmdir mydir
# if the folder still contains files that you also want to delete use
rm -rf mydir


# Files -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# to create an empty file or update the date of a file, use
touch file.txt

# enter text into a file use either
echo This is a text > file.txt
# or the text editor
nano file.txt

# feed an output of a command into a file use >
ls > out.txt

# show the full content of a text file all at once
cat file.txt
# show the full content of a text file page-wise
less file.txt

# copy a file with
cp file.txt newfile.txt

# rename a file or move it to a different path with
mv file.txt newfile.txt

# change permissions of a file with chmod
# the first parameter is either u g or o, u for user, g for group, o for other/public
# the second parameter is either + for add or - for remove
# the third parameter is either r for read permission, w for write and x for execute permission of the file
chmod u+r file.txt
chmod g-w file.txt
chmod o+x file.txt
# you can also change permissions for all three user categories at once using the sum of the following numbers
# 0 no permission, 1 execute, 2 write, 4 read. So, to give the user full permission, the group and other only
# read and execute you would use
chmod 755 file.txt

# to find a file with its name use
find . -name file.txt

# to remove a file use
rm file.txt


# Superuser (administrator mode) ------------------------------------------------------------------

# sometime you need administrator permissions to do something. Then you need the command 'sudo' (superuser do)
# followed by the actual command that you want to execute, e.g.
sudo cd /sys 

# you have to work on several commands that require the superuser, you can switch the user to sudo with
sudo su
# when you are done, switch back to your usual username with
exit


# Installing and updating software 

# Always download the latest information on files from the internet with
sudo apt update

# Then, you can install software, e.g. curl (to download files) with
sudo apt install curl

# to update all software, use
sudo apt upgrade


# Logs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# logs are important to understand what is going on on your computer. They are all stored in 
/var/log


# File system -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# display free/used disk space with
df -h

# display free/used memory/RAM with
free -h


# Compression -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# To demonstrate how to compress files we first need to download a large file
# We download a file from the Open Data Montreal website with curl
# parameter -o defines the output file name, -L is a redirection to the actual file (otherwise it would 
# download the HTML information about the file)
curl -o file.csv -L https://data.montreal.ca/dataset/2fc8a2b9-1556-410e-a118-c46e97e9f19e/resource/71e86320-e35c-4b4c-878a-e52124294355/download/donneesouvertes-interventions-sim.csv

# compress a file with gzip. It will replace the uncompressed file. 
gzip file.txt

# uncompress with 
gunzip file.txt.gz

# to create a backup for several files or a folder use 
tar -cf file.tar mydir
# to also compress the files/folder use
tar -czf file.tar.gz file1.txt file2.txt
# to extract a tar file use
tar -xf file.tar.gz


# History of commands -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
history
# to reuse a command type ! followed by the row number
!12


# User management ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# check who is logged in on your computer at the moment
w

# list all users for your computer. Note /etc/passwd lists all users
# including users that are only used for system purposes. The egrep command
# uses regular expresssions (regex) to filter the list to actual users
# that have an id from 1000 onwards
cat /etc/passwd | egrep :[0-9]{4}: 
# list all groups for your computer
cat /etc/group

# create a new user with adduser (where <uname> is the new username you want to create) 
sudo adduser <uname>
# create a new group with addgroup (where <gname> is the new group name)
sudo addgroup <gname>
# make a user superuser with 
sudo usermod -aG sudo <uname>
# add a user to a group
sudo usermod -aG <gname> <uname>
# remove a user from a group
sudo gpasswd -d <uname> <gname>
# remove a user
sudo deluser <uname>
# remove a group
sudo delgroup <gname>

# change user name
su <uname>
# display your username at the moment
whoami


# Remote log-in into a server or computer -----------------------------------------------------

# with SSH (where uname is your username on the remote computer and server is either
# the IP address or the domain name, e.g. test.mcgill.ca, of the remote computer)
ssh <uname>@<servername>
# if SSH doesn't use the default port 22 you can also add the number of the port with -p
ssh <uname>@<server> -p <port>


# Machine maintenance -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# list the name of your computer (hostname)
hostname
# find your internet connection details use
ip link #LOWER_UP is the actual physical network
# and your ip address with
ip addr
# test if your internet works with
ping 8.8.8.8
# or 
traceroute www.mcgill.ca
